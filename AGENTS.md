# Agent guidelines

- Use short sections with bullet lists for documentation changes. Keep sentences concise.
- Put shell commands inside fenced code blocks tagged as `bash`.
- Reference workspace-aware npm scripts (for example `npm run dev:backend`) when noting
  how to run tasks.
- In PR messages, include a brief summary of the documentation updates and list any
  tests or checks that were run.
